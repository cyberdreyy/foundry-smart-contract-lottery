# Proveably Random Raffle Contracts

## About

This code is to create a proveably random smart contract lottery

## What I want to do?

1. Users can enter by paying for a ticket
    1. The ticket fees are going to go to the owner during the draw
2. After X period of time, the lottery will automatically draw a winner
    1. And this will be done programmatically
3. Using chainlink VRF & Chainlink Automation
    1. Chainlink VRF -> Randomness
    2. CHainlink Automation -> Time based trigger
